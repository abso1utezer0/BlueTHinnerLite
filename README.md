# Installing
Simply download the latest ZIP file from [the releases page](https://github.com/abso1utezer0/BlueThinnerLite/releases/) and extract it to the desired location.

# FAQ
## How do I use this?
Keep an eye on the [Epic Mickey Docs website](https://docs.epicmickey.wiki). I'll be adding documentation there as I get the time.
## Why is the source code not available?
This project is being submitted as my create task for the AP Computer Science Principles class. Collegeboard checks the content of your code to see if it matches code found online to catch plagiarism. As all code is submitted anonymously, even though I am the one who submitted the code and created this repository, they have no way to verify that and will believe I plagiarized. As such, the source code will not be available until the project has been fully graded by Collegeboard (mid-summer of 2024). If you want to see some of the methods I used for modifying the files, check out [the Rust library](https://github.com/abso1utezer0/epic_mickey_lib_rs) I made. It uses a lot of the same code, though translated over to Rust.
## I can't open the application, it's being blocked as a virus
This should not be happening as I test any releases before sending them out. If it is occurring, please follow [this guide](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/blob/develop/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/antivirus.md#reporting-false-positives-to-av-vendors) if you have time to spare and then force Windows Defender to ignore the folder. Its unfortunately pretty common for Windows to mark PyInstaller apps as viruses, and there's not really much I can do to fix it other than moving code around until its no longer seen as a virus. Windows Defender is pretty stupid.
